This is my first JavaScript project, and the goal here is to build a single-page web app that allows users to draw a pixel art on a customizable canvas!

An example output is given below:

## How to Use

Any user can do the following with the code:
- Dynamically set the size of the table as an N-by-M grid.
- Choose any color
- Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.

To do this, download the `index.html`, `styles.css` and `design.js` file. Then open the `index.html` file on any browser, and perfrom the above procedure.
